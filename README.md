# Calculator
- Approach
  - Decided to go with functional component and use hook for the state, because i can do more in less code, look much cleaner
  -  Bootstrapped with `creat-react-app` because this is mostly the standard way of doing it, it give us all the necessary files and save us extra time
  - Got rid of  unnecessary files from src and public folder, because i dont want un used file
  - Decided to write all the code in App.js itself, since it is fairly simple project, creating a component is not required
  
- Assumpptions
  - Responsiveness is not required, so didt pay attention to it
  - Not saving the history of calculation

- complexity
  - Since i use eval function the code was no complex in terms of caclulation

- If u had more time
  -  give user the option to see history of the calculation
  - improve the UI/UX
  - Maybe try out more complex operaions

- Did not use any open source code
